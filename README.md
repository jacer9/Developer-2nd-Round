# Developer-2nd-Round
Code for 2nd Round of Developer applications

This code was written by me as a part of my group CS101 Final in spring 2022. This code was written for a specific function that connected to another team members function, so my code may not have an output when just running it through a compiler. However, I assure you it is correct and I can prove it with the grade break downs of our final project should need be. Thank you again for this opportunity!
