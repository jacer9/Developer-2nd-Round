# Developer-2nd-Round
Code for 2nd Round of Developer applications

This code was written by me as a part of my group CS101 Final in spring 2022. This code was written for a specific function that connected to another team members function, so my code may not have an output when just running it through a compiler. However, I assure you it is correct and I can prove it with the grade break downs of our final project should need be. The goal of this function is to take a list of dna strings and return a substring that contains the longest sequence of letters possible within the given dna string list. This function requires a list of dna strings to be given to work. 

Thank you again for this opportunity!
